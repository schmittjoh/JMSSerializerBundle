Please note that to use the current version of JMSSerializerBundle you need to have the HEAD version of the metadata bundle. Change 

     [metadata]
       git=http://github.com/schmittjoh/metadata.git
       version=1.0.0

to
    [metadata]
       git=http://github.com/schmittjoh/metadata.git

And also remove the metadata entry in deps.lock.
